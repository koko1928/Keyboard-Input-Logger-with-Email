# Keyboard-Input-Logger-with-Email
This is key logger.
This code logs keyboard input and sends an email, including the input history, to a specified email address at a regular interval. It does not require Gmail and provides a simple implementation. Please ensure to implement the email sending logic appropriately (e.g., using SMTP) and replace the to_address variable with the actual recipient email address.
